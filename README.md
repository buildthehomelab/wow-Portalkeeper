# Portalkeeper

> **Vaultrona fork.** This build is made for the Vaultrona realm (wow.vaultrona.com):
>
> - The realm is built in. Players install it, log in with their game account and play; there's no realm file to place.
> - **INSTALL WOW** downloads World of Warcraft 3.3.5a over BitTorrent. Players download from each other and from the realm's web seed, and players on the same home network are tried first.
> - The realm's required and recommended patches and its required addons install and update by themselves, also over BitTorrent with an HTTP fallback. Players only choose optional addons. Patches get a torrent when realm.conf points them at the realm's `patches/` folder (`https://wow.vaultrona.com/realm/patches/<file>`); patches anywhere else download over plain HTTP. When realm.conf drops a patch, the launcher takes it out of the client (only while the file is still exactly the patch it installed) and puts back the file it replaced: its own backup if that passes the client torrent's hashes, else a fresh copy from the realm's web seed.
> - While Portalkeeper is open it shares finished downloads with other players: only copies that exactly match the realm's, never while the game runs, and with an upload limit (Settings → Account and sharing).
>
> - Installed Windows builds update themselves: a new release downloads in the background, is checked against GitHub's published SHA-256, and installs when you're not playing (Settings can turn this off).
>
> - One clean launcher screen: realm status, a single status card (log in, install, downloading, up to date), settings and a big ENTER REALM button.
>
> - Patch changes clear the client's `Cache` folder. For server changes the client also caches (items, spells, quests), change the text in the realm folder's `cache-version.txt` (for example `date +%s > realm-public/cache-version.txt`) and every launcher clears Cache once before its next launch.
>
> The launcher's title font is [Cinzel](https://github.com/NDISCOVER/Cinzel) by Natanael Gama, under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (`src/Portalkeeper/Assets/Fonts/Cinzel-OFL.txt`).
>
> The server side is the portal's launcher API ([wow-mod-azerothcore-portal](https://github.com/buildthehomelab/wow-mod-azerothcore-portal), `api/launcher/`). For development, `PORTALKEEPER_LAUNCHER_API` points a build at a test portal. `dotnet run --project tests/Portalkeeper.RuntimeTests -- launcher` runs the fork's offline checks.


Portalkeeper is an independent realm launcher, addon manager and public realm-information viewer for **World of Warcraft 3.3.5a, build 12340**. It remains **under development**. It is not affiliated with AzerothCore or Blizzard Entertainment.

Linux functionality has been exercised, including focused Armory checks. Windows portable and installed releases have also been validated on Windows, including client launch, native StormLib loading, Armory character previews, Start Menu integration and uninstall. This is not exhaustive validation of every launcher, addon, client or realm configuration. Character previews are static; animation and particle effects are outside the current scope.

## Current functionality

- Validate a local client, discover one realm configuration, check authentication/world TCP reachability, prepare `realmlist.wtf` and optional realm selection in `WTF/Config.wtf`, and launch WoW directly on Windows or through Wine on Linux. An unavailable health probe alone does not block launch.
- Manage realm-required, recommended and personal addons, discover GitHub addon metadata, install/update managed folders and back up replacements. Required-addon readiness gates entry; unrelated addons and SavedVariables are retained.
- Display optional realm news, a public monthly event calendar and the Armory, with downloaded-data fallback when available.
- Search/filter the Armory roster by players or playerbots, inspect the existing equipment paper doll, quality colors, icons and detailed tooltips, and load dressed static character previews in the background.
- Apply optional transmog appearances, including hidden equipment, while keeping original item information in slots/tooltips. Save the display preference per realm Armory URL.

Portalkeeper does not distribute the client or store game account credentials. Launching writes the selected client's realmlist and, when configured, its `WTF/Config.wtf` realmName; addon installation writes managed addon folders. Preview extraction itself only reads client archives and does not modify them.

## Build and run

Source builds require the **.NET 10 SDK** and package restore access. Git is useful for obtaining source, not required by the running addon downloader. From the repository root:

```sh
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --project src/Portalkeeper/Portalkeeper.csproj
```

The root [Portalkeeper.slnx](Portalkeeper.slnx) and [application project](src/Portalkeeper/Portalkeeper.csproj) are the build targets. Source runs require the SDK; the Linux publishing script creates a self-contained .NET application:

```sh
./scripts/publish-linux.sh
```

It requires `dotnet` and `zip` and currently produces `dist/Portalkeeper-0.2.1-linux-x64.zip`. Self-contained .NET does **not** bundle StormLib or guarantee all operating-system GUI/native libraries are installed. The script checks for private realm files and removes development symbols.

## Windows releases

Two Windows release artifacts are offered, both built from the same project version (currently `0.2.1`). Both bundle the .NET runtime and `StormLib.dll`; no PowerShell launch or install script is required.

### Portable

```
Download  Portalkeeper-<version>-win-x64.zip
Extract   the ZIP into a folder
Run       Portalkeeper.exe
```

### Installed

```
Download  Portalkeeper-Setup-<version>.exe
Run       the installer (per-user, no administrator rights required)
Launch    Portalkeeper from the Start Menu
```

The installer retains the stable AppId `{64CF5E71-169A-422C-86D5-AC9A62E0AEEE}`, the existing installation directory, and per-user installation (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`). Close Portalkeeper and run the newer installer: it replaces binaries in the existing installation without a manual uninstall or duplicate application entry. `%APPDATA%\Portalkeeper` and the selected WoW installation are not installer payload. User-created realm files beside the application remain available for first-launch import. See [upgrade instructions](docs/schema-v1-upgrade.md).

### Maintainers: creating the release artifacts

Both commands run the `win-x64` self-contained publish and validate that
`StormLib.dll` and `StormLib.LICENSE.txt` are present. They refuse to package
private `*.realm.conf` files and strip development-only files out of the ZIP.
Run them from the repository root:

```
pwsh scripts/publish-win.ps1 -Installer
```

This produces:

- `dist/Portalkeeper-<version>-win-x64.zip`
- `dist/Portalkeeper-Setup-<version>.exe`

The portable ZIP alone is `pwsh scripts/publish-win.ps1` (or `scripts/build-win-installer.ps1` for both). Compiling the installer requires [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) (6.2 or newer); `publish-win.ps1` reports a clear error if `ISCC.exe` is not found and still creates the portable ZIP in that case. No Visual Studio is needed.

## Client and realm setup

Select the local folder containing `Wow.exe` and `Data` in Settings, for example `/path/to/WoW-335a` or `C:\Games\WoW-335a`. Executable validation checks supported metadata/build markers; it does not validate every archive. Linux launching requires `wine` or `wine64` on PATH. The launcher honors `WINEPREFIX`, otherwise tries matching desktop-launcher prefix information and then Wine's default prefix. Settings shows the detected launch environment.

Portalkeeper 0.2.1 consumes **SchemaVersion=1**, generated and published by the server's **mod-realm-config** module. Portalkeeper has no database connection. Obtain the realm's public file from its administrator; [config/example.realm.conf](config/example.realm.conf) shows the complete contract.

Place your non-example `*.realm.conf` files in the persistent `Portalkeeper/realms` directory (Windows `%APPDATA%\Portalkeeper\realms`; Linux `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Portalkeeper/realms`, normally `~/.config/Portalkeeper/realms`). On first use, the launcher also discovers files beside the executable or in its `config/` folder and the working directory. It copies a single file to persistent storage and retains the original. When two or more usable files exist, Settings → Realm → CHANGE REALM opens a selector showing each realm’s name, description, address, and legacy status. The selected configuration path is saved with settings; switching retains the WoW client and only refreshes realm/client/component state. If the saved file disappears, a sole remaining realm is selected automatically; multiple remaining realms prompt you to choose in Settings. Persistent configurations take precedence over adjacent bootstrap files. With no saved selection, a sole valid Schema v1 realm also retains precedence over legacy files; those legacy realms remain selectable. Successful legacy migration follows the new persistent Schema v1 path. The bundled example and unusable configurations are not selectable.

MANAGE PATCHES is shown only when the active realm defines managed patches. Switching realms updates its visibility without installing or removing patches.

Portalkeeper checks the official Hisha/Portalkeeper latest stable GitHub release at startup at most approximately once per 24 hours. Attempts, including failures, are saved in settings; automatic failures stay quiet. Settings → CHECK FOR UPDATES bypasses the interval. A newer release appears as a non-blocking notice with VIEW RELEASE, which opens its official GitHub release page. Portalkeeper does not download or install updates. This advisory check is separate from a realm’s `MinimumVersion` requirement.

`[Realm] Name` is the administrator-controlled Portalkeeper display name. Optional `[Realm] GameRealmName` is the actual WoW realm name advertised by the authserver; it can differ from `Name` (for example, `Name=Eitrigg Realm` and `GameRealmName=Eitrigg`). On Enter Realm, Portalkeeper continues writing `[Connection] Address` to the locale's `realmlist.wtf` and, when `GameRealmName` is nonblank, writes `SET realmName "<GameRealmName>"` to `WTF/Config.wtf` before launching WoW. It replaces an existing realmName setting or adds one while retaining unrelated settings. Older realm files without `GameRealmName` leave `Config.wtf` untouched. `WorldPort` is not used to select a realm in client configuration. `[Client]` supplies version, build, executable name and optional SHA-256, preserving existing executable metadata/build-marker validation. `[Portalkeeper] MinimumVersion` uses semantic version comparison and gives an upgrade message if incompatible.

`[Services]` supplies `NewsURL`, `CalendarURL`, `ArmoryURL`, `StatusURL`, `ManifestURL` and canonical `ConfigURL`. Empty optional URLs disable the corresponding feature. News, Calendar and Armory retain their existing viewers. `StatusURL` and `ManifestURL` are exposed by the model for discovery; the current application uses TCP health probes and the INI addon/patch catalog, not a second manifest. Neither optional endpoint is required to launch.

Startup and **CHECK AGAIN** refresh Schema v1 realms from `ConfigURL`. Downloads must pass all Schema v1 checks before atomic replacement, and failed refreshes retain the last known-good file. Legacy `[Server]`/`[Updates]` configs use their `UpdateURL` to attempt migration into a separate persistent Schema v1 copy while retaining the original untouched. Missing URLs, failed downloads or failed saves keep a valid legacy realm usable in clearly labeled compatibility mode, with the existing client validation and connection/launch behavior. **CHECK AGAIN** can retry migration. See [migration and upgrades](docs/schema-v1-upgrade.md).

## Optional integrations and dependencies

| Feature | Required for that feature | Optional / fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Launcher | Local supported client; configured realm; Wine on Linux | TCP health is advisory. |
| Addon installation | Writable client addon directory and reachable source | Schema v1 catalog; personal GitHub sources. |
| News/calendar | HTTP(S) schema-v1 feeds from mod-realm-news/mod-realm-calendar | Last cached feed on failure. No server database access. |
| Armory equipment | HTTP(S) schema-v1 mod-realm-armory feed | Cached roster/profiles; icons may be unavailable. |
| Static previews | Local compatible client MPQs and native StormLib matching process architecture | Missing assets/library keep equipment UI and an explanatory placeholder. |
| Transmog previews | Explicit capability in both roster and profile, resolved appearance metadata | Older/unsupported feeds show original equipment. No mandatory mod-transmog dependency. |

Linux preview loading tries `libstorm.so` then `libstorm.so.9`; Windows tries `StormLib.dll`. Install the native library and its transitive dependencies where the operating-system loader can find them. The Windows project and Linux publishing script bundle their respective StormLib binaries. A macOS library name exists in the resolver, but macOS runtime/launch support is not validated.

## Addon management

Realm addons are discovered dynamically from all `[Addon.<key>]` sections. There may be zero, one or many; the historical `config/addons.json` is no longer authoritative or shipped in releases. Required addons must exist with a `.toc` and have no known supported version/commit update before **ENTER REALM**. Recommended and Optional addons do not block launch; an absent Optional addon does not create a readiness warning.

GitHub sources reuse existing commit discovery and ZIP installation. `Ref` selects a branch or tag (including a release's tag); empty means the default branch. HTTP sources supply a ZIP containing the configured addon folder and a `.toc`. Schema v1 does not supply an addon hash; HTTP archives still undergo path, size, link and `.toc` validation. HTTPS is preferred; intentional HTTP remains supported. Downloaded scripts/executables are never executed by the installer.

`InstallDirectory` identifies a folder under `<client>/Interface/AddOns`. Existing installations are recognized through folder/TOC inspection and existing version/commit records. Upgrading Portalkeeper does not reinstall addons. Source failures retain local inspection and report unavailable update information. INSTALL/UPDATE and UPDATE ALL are explicit actions. UNINSTALL moves only the selected folder to a recoverable backup; REMOVE on personal entries only removes management. Components absent from the current realm catalog are never automatically deleted.

## Realm patches

All `[Patch.<key>]` entries appear in **MANAGE PATCHES**, showing name, requirement, destination and validation state. HTTP(S) sources install to `<client>/<InstallDirectory>/<FileName>`. Required patches block launch when missing or hash-invalid. Recommended and Optional patches do not. SHA-256 is checked when supplied; without it, existence is the supported check and the UI states that no hash was supplied.

INSTALL / REPAIR stages a download beside the destination, validates it, backs up any existing file and replaces it only after success. Valid existing hashed patches are not downloaded again. Explicit action can refresh hashless patches. REMOVE requires confirmation and backs up the selected file. No directory-wide pruning occurs. Paths reject roots, traversal, unsafe Windows filenames and symbolic links/junctions; management metadata cannot be targeted.

### Dynamically allocated WoW MPQs

Use `InstallMode=WowPatch` for realm-managed cumulative MPQs. Omit both
`FileName` and `InstallDirectory` (even empty values are rejected):

```ini
[Patch.realm-content]
Name=Realm Content
Requirement=Required
SourceType=HTTP
SourceURL=https://downloads.example.com/realm-content-000002.mpq
InstallMode=WowPatch
SHA256=<64-character SHA-256 of the published artifact>
```

The server supplies the artifact, not a physical `patch-N.MPQ` name. After
validating the selected client, Portalkeeper selects an unused slot in `Data`,
from `patch-4.MPQ` through `patch-9.MPQ`. Stock patch slots remain reserved.
The numeric range is deliberately bounded: 3.3.5a custom numeric suffixes are
single digits; this mode does not allocate letter suffixes or `patch-10.MPQ`.
See the [MPQ creation tutorial](https://www.wowmodding.net/topic/1460-41-creating-your-first-mpq-patch/)
for the numeric/letter naming convention.

Ownership is stored in `<client>/.portalkeeper/wow-patches.json`, as a realm
identity, patch key and portable relative destination such as `Data/patch-6.MPQ`.
The realm identity derives from its name, address and auth/world ports; the
artifact URL and hash do not participate. Changing the realm name or endpoint
creates a different identity; relocating its configuration file does not.
Keep this metadata with the client. Missing metadata means existing MPQs are
unowned; filenames and matching hashes alone never grant ownership.

Each patch key gets a separate persistent allocation. All recorded realms and
stale entries reserve their slots, including temporarily missing files. Filename
collisions and ownership checks ignore case, including on Linux/Wine. Unowned
files are never overwritten by WowPatch. Ambiguous case variants, unsafe paths,
symlinks/junctions, malformed ownership records and exhausted slots fail with an
error. The current realm's ordinary File destinations also reserve slots.

Updates and rollbacks reuse the allocated destination when `SourceURL` and
`SHA256` change. They use the same staged download, hash verification and backup
pipeline as ordinary patches. Publish SHA-256 with each artifact so Required
patches can verify the advertised version. Failed downloads or hash checks leave
the installed MPQ and existing ownership unchanged; an invalid Required patch
continues to block launch. Inspection never allocates or downloads. Explicit
REMOVE backs up the MPQ and retains its allocation for reinstall. Removing an
entry from realm.conf does not delete its file or metadata.

New ownership is saved atomically after successful installation; a persistence
failure removes the newly installed file. An interruption between those steps
can leave an unowned MPQ, which Portalkeeper will conservatively leave untouched.
Client-local locking prevents simultaneous WowPatch operations from assigning
the same slot. All installed MPQs remain in Data across realm switches; use
separate clients for realms whose content is incompatible.

Omitting `InstallMode` still means `File`. Explicit `InstallMode=File` is also
supported, with the existing required `FileName` and `InstallDirectory` behavior.
Unknown mode names are configuration errors. No MPQ/DBC merging or automatic
stale-file cleanup is performed.

## Regression checks

```sh
dotnet run --project tests/Portalkeeper.Tests -c Release
bash tests/install-linux-upgrade.sh
```

The dependency-free test executable covers parsing, migration/refresh rollback, semantic versions, path safety, client validation, preserved settings/addons, and real loopback HTTP addon/patch downloads. The shell test runs the Linux installer twice against an isolated fake package and verifies preservation. See [verification](docs/schema-v1-upgrade.md#verification).

## News, calendar and Armory

News displays published articles with title, summary/body, category, author and local publication time, with pinned articles first. Calendar displays the published date range, month navigation and selected-day public events, including all-day and timed events; it is a viewer, not an event editor.

The server-side Armory module writes `index.json` plus `characters/<guid>.json`. An operator serves that directory over HTTP(S); Portalkeeper requests the roster and resolves profiles relative to `ArmoryURL`. The module neither hosts HTTP nor sends client models. Portalkeeper reads local MPQs to resolve the JSON's race, gender, customization and equipment display IDs.

Tooltips retain the actual equipped item's name/quality, armor, stats, resistances, damage, speed/DPS, sockets with equipped gems, enchants, socket bonus, supplied spell names/triggers, flavor text, durability and supported requirements. Null enchant fields do not render; invalid enchant data is not converted into invented effects. Spell names and trigger labels are not a complete WoW spell-formula engine.

In Settings, **Show transmogrified appearances** sits below **Hide while WoW is running**, defaults on and persists per Armory URL. Unsupported feeds disable it with “This realm doesn’t support transmogrification.” Turning it off renders original gear while “Transmogrified to: …” remains in tooltips. Explicitly hidden appearances omit the visual item, not its equipment slot.

See [current preview behavior](docs/armory-0.6-integration.md), [transmog details](docs/armory-transmog.md), [caching and troubleshooting](docs/operations.md) and [verification / Windows checklist](docs/verification.md). [Known implementation issues](docs/implementation-issues.md) are recorded separately.

## Privacy and historical material

Settings and caches live under the operating system's per-user application-data directory, in `Portalkeeper/`; client assets are not redistributed. Item icons can be fetched from the external `wow.zamimg.com` icon service. News/calendar/Armory are public-feed consumers, not authenticated account services.

The [MPQ proof report](docs/armory-0.6-proof.md) is historical research, not current setup instructions. The actual checkout does not contain the standalone probe or earlier Armory test harnesses mentioned by historical reports; those references describe prior evidence, not runnable commands in this checkout. No developer tools were removed in this documentation review.
